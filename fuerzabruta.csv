Danny's Hot (And-Not-So-Hot) Takes; DanGuy96; I hope this movie is as big as Oppenheimer and be the thing that gets Adam Driver an Oscar if it is that good.
Teta FC- Ender of Streaks; GoonerDriz; Just watched Oppenheimer last night, and I must say, it's a cinematic masterpiece. I thoroughly enjoyed it. It was 3 hours long, and I didn't even notice the time passing by. It was that gripping. I wish I had seen it at the movies. I'm definitely gonna rewatch. 👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿
Harold E. Creacy, Esq., LL.M. ✊🏾🙏🏾☯️; @CreacyHarold; Yes, I saw two notable movies recently. First I saw Chris Nolan’s Oppenheimer. Though it was at least a half-hour too long it was still entertaining & beautifully made. The second was “Doubt” starring Meryl Streep & Philip Seymour Hoffman, two of my favorite actors. It was great!

Thexx2!!2;thexx22;Watched Oppenheimer last night. Thought it was a really good movie. My main take away is it appears that women in Berkeley have *always* been psychotic, miserable Communists
James Hilt;jim_hilt;The new Oppenheimer movie shows he taught Quantum Mechanics & Black Holes whose gravitation pull is so strong not even light can escape it. The Republican personality cult Party of Trump acts like a Black Hole pulling into darkness truth & justice and the light of our Democracy.

penguin;@DaPixelPenguin;Replying to @DaPixelPenguin and @simbagoatedfr oppenheimer is also a standalone movie that (hopefully) won’t see any sequels as opposed to the other two films which have to work in the confines of a trilogy. for what they’re worth, i believe all three films have immense strengths

GunFreeZone Blog;@GunFreeZone;Replying to @BradRTorgersen and @AaronCSmith1 Nolan is a genius. His movies I like best are when he is tethered by outside forces. For Oppenheimer, it's history. For Batman, it's the comic canon. When he's free to pursue his passion, it's amazing, but also a lot to try and wrap your mind around.
hq 🧸;@simbagoatedfr;Replying to @DaPixelPenguin Oh it’s cause you said of our generation. So I assumed u meant like recent movies lol. Also I used Oppenheimer and Batman as comparisons as well because I think they executed the problems a longer movie face way way better then Dune 2

Melody Ann Haase;@melodyannhaase;"Replying to @Arts_Channel and @ajaxsingh No. The best WWII movie of the year was Godzilla Minus One. I saw it in Japan at an IMAX, and I felt all the things. I was terrified. I cried. I was happy. Such a great film. Oppenheimer was an incoherent jumble of scenes like a Harry Potter film."
